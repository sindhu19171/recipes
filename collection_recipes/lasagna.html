    <h3>Directions to prepare</h3>
    <p>
        Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
Boil the lasagna noodles according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
In a skillet over medium heat, cook the ground beef or Italian sausage until browned. Add chopped onions and minced garlic. Cook until onions are soft.
Stir in the tomato sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Simmer for about 10-15 minutes, then remove from heat.
In a separate bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, 1 cup of mozzarella cheese, and half of the grated Parmesan cheese.
In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom. Arrange a layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce.
Spread a layer of the cheese mixture over the noodles, then top with more meat sauce. Repeat these layers (noodles, cheese mixture, meat sauce) until you've used all your ingredients, finishing with a layer of meat sauce on top.
Sprinkle the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top of the lasagna.
Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.
Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes until the cheese is melted and bubbly.
Let it cool for a few minutes, garnish with fresh basil if desired, then slice and serve.
